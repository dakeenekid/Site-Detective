# WebCheck
Amazon alexa skill to check the current status of a web page. First alexa skill that I have made, created with flask-ask. 

This alexa skill was created for the purpose of entering Amazon's promotion to create an alexa skill and recieve a free echo dot or other swag. 

The project wasn't terribly difficult, and with a few spare hours of learning flask-ask I managed to successfully create the project.
